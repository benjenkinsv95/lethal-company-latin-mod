# Default value: SNARE FLEA\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 30%\n\nScientific name: Dolus-scolopendra. \nA very large arthropod of the class chilopoda. Its body produces a silk which it primarily uses to propel itself to places where it is concealed. Its exoskeleton is somewhat fragile, and they can die from long falls. The snare flea does not produce venom, nor does it have a strong bite. It makes up for this weakness with its ability to tighten itself around large prey to suffocate.\n\nThe snare flea thrives in dark, warm areas. It cannot survive low temperatures and generally avoids open air and sunlight take the rats outside or just beat the hell otu of them! i think their insides could make a good milkshake,,\n\n
# Snare flea = 陷阱跳蚤\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：30%\n\n學名：Dolus-scolopendra\n這是一種非常大型的節肢動物，屬於多足綱。其身體產生絲線，主要用來推進自己到隱蔽的地方。它的外骨骼相對脆弱，並且可能因長距離跌落而死亡。捕獲跳蚤不產生毒液，也沒有強力的咬合力。它透過緊緊纏繞大型獵物來窒息，以彌補這一弱點。\n\n捕獲跳蚤在黑暗、溫暖的地區繁盛。它無法在低溫下生存，並且通常避免開放空氣和陽光。把老鼠帶到外面或者徹底打敗它們！我想它們的內部可能做成奶昔味道不錯。

# Default value: Bracken -- AKA flower man!\n\nit was flower man, you can\'t say othrwise! i wanted to find his body .You were the cowards\n\nScientific name: Rapax-folium\nThere is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin the color and texture of a red beat. The name was coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine. The purpose of these is believed to be for intimidation, however not much is known about the specifics of bracken behaviour due to its illusiveness and low population.\n\nWe know a little from accounts by wildlife experts who have encountered it. is a lone hunter with high intelligence. Its behavior can seem aloof; it exhibits high aggression even when unprovoked, yet it quickly backs off when confronted. However, brackens are known to up their hostility when cornered or simply watched for a long time. For this reason it\'s recommended to keep an eye on it but not to stare it down. No specimens have been collected dead or alive. It\'s theorized that upon death their bodies undergo a rapid decomposition process which is unique from other large animals.\n\n
# Bracken = 花人布拉肯 -- 它就是花人，別的說法都不成立！\n\n我想找到它的屍體。你們都是懦夫。\n\n學名：Rapax-folium\n布拉肯屬於哪個屬仍有爭議。它是一種雙足脊椎動物，皮膚呈現紅色甜菜的顏色和質地。這個名稱是因為看起來像葉子從其上脊椎突出。這些葉子被認為是用來威嚇的，然而由於其神秘性和稀少的族群，關於布拉肯行為的具體細節仍不為人所知。\n\n我們從野生動物專家的描述中了解到一些資訊。它是一個孤獨的獵手，智力高。它的行為看起來有些疏離；即使未受挑釁，它也表現出高度的侵略性，但面對對抗時卻迅速退縮。然而，當布拉肯被逼入絕境或被長時間觀察時，它們會增加敵意。因此，建議留意它，但不要盯著它。未曾收集到任何活體或死亡標本。有理論推測，它們死亡後的身體會經歷一個與其他大型動物不同的快速分解過程。\n\n

# Default value: HOARDING BUG\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Linepithema-crassus\nHoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.\n\nHoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd
# Hoarding bug = 囤積蟲\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：0%\n\n學名：Linepithema-crassus\n囤積蟲（膜翅目）是大型的、具社會性的昆蟲。雖然經常獨自生活，但它們也與同種成員共享巢穴。它們平均身高約3英尺，體型膨脹。它們的體液和血液的稀薄，以及甲殼的材質使它們體重輕，能夠用膜質翅膀飛行。這也使得它們的身體有些透明。\n\n囤積蟲因其領土性質而得名。一旦它們選擇了一個地方作為巢穴，就會尋找任何可以找到的物體來裝飾它，並將這些物體作為巢穴的一部分進行保護。囤積蟲單獨時並不像在大型蜂巢中那麼危險。然而，如果被單獨留下，囤積蟲出人意料地中立，並不構成太大危險。我們愛這些愚蠢的擁抱蟲！！ - 這是不屈不撓的 Sigurd 的留言。

# Default value: HYGRODERE\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%, if you\'re faster than a snail!\n\nScientific name: Hygrodere \nA eukaryotic organism classified within the paraphyletic group Prostita. With the incredible speed of reproduction, these small organisms can multiply to millions. Hygrodere rarely split apart, instead choosing to form large, viscous masses which can take up large amounts of space and become a danger to deal with, requiring large tools or lures to relocate.\n\nHygrodere are drawn to heat and oxygen and can detect it from seemingly anywhere. There\'s almost nothing organic they can\'t convert to their own body mass. Nothing has been found to poison them. Constantly replacing themselves, they can persist for hundreds of thousands of years. If you ever find yourself cornered, find a tall object to stand on top of; hygroderes have trouble climbing. they have great taste! cause I made a friend with one somehow,, and we think it was my music. \n
# Hygrodere = 史萊姆\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：0%，如果你比蝸牛快！\n\n學名：Hygrodere \n史萊姆是一種歸類於並系群 Prostita 的真核生物。這些小型生物具有驚人的繁殖速度，可以迅速繁殖至數百萬個體。水濕體很少分裂，而是選擇形成大型的黏稠體，這些黏稠體可以佔據大量空間，處理起來相當危險，需要大型工具或誘餌來重新定位。\n\n史萊姆被熱量和氧氣吸引，似乎可以從幾乎任何地方探測到這些元素。幾乎沒有什麼有機物質它們無法轉化為自己的體質。尚未發現任何對它們有毒的物質。它們不斷地自我更換，可以存活數十萬年。如果你發現自己被困住了，找一個高物體站在上面；水濕體不擅長攀爬。它們品味很好！因為我不知怎的與其中一個成了朋友，我們認為是我的音樂吸引了它。\n

# Default value: Thumpers\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Pistris-saevus\nHalves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.\n\nThey are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can\'t easily track prey.\n\nDue to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that thumpers are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.
# Thumper = 跳擊者\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：90%\n\n名：Pistris-saevus\n跳擊者，或稱為半身魚，是軟骨魚綱下一種極具攻擊性的肉食性物種。它們的骨骼是軟骨質的，賦予它們伸縮自如且類似橡膠的質地。它們的名稱來自於它們必須吃掉自己的下半部腿部才能逃脫孵化的蛋殼；它們的下半部腿部本來就幾乎無法正常功能。它們的前肢或前腿非常強壯，偶爾用來踏踏獵物。它們能夠在直線上達到極高的速度。\n\n它們是不知疲倦的獵手，通常位於食物鏈的頂端。它們的主要弱點是智力低下和完全缺乏聽力。如果你遇到跳擊者，生存的最佳方法是離開它的視線，因為它在轉彎時速度較慢，不容易追蹤獵物。\n\n由於這個物種快速且不穩定的進化，一些理論家認為跳擊者是在薊星雲周圍的行星上，突變數量增加導致更高物種分化水平的例子之一。

# Default value: EYELESS DOG\n\nScientific name: Leo caecus\nA large mammal of the class Saeptivus. They are social, hunting in very large packs. They have also been called \"breathing lions\" for their recognizable sound and large mouths. They are endurance hunters and attempt to make up for their lack of sight with their sense of hearing. It\'s a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs.\n\nTheir behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey\'s exact location which are often incorrect. 
# EyelessDog = 無眼犬\n\n學名：Leo caecus\n無眼犬是 Saeptivus 綱的一種大型哺乳動物。它們具有社會性，以非常大的群體進行狩獵。由於它們獨特的聲音和大嘴，它們也被稱為“呼吸的獅子”。它們是耐力型獵手，試圖以聽覺彌補視覺的缺失。流行的迷思是它們經常將自己同類的聲音誤認為獵物，導致在自己的群體內發生爭鬥。\n\n無眼犬的行為與其他群居動物不同，它們傾向於分散開來覆蓋更大的距離。當無眼犬發現獵物時，它會吼叫以警告附近的其他同類，這些同類也會發出警報，有時會導致一種連鎖反應。無眼犬在成群時可能非常危險。然而，它們在性格上笨拙，對獵物確切位置的猜測往往不準確。

# Default value: FOREST KEEPER\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 50%\n\nScientific name: Satyrid-proceritas\nBelieved to share a common ancestor with rapax-folium, these behemoths are called Forest Keepers for the biomes they often inhabit. Their bodies bare markings on their front and back which mimic eyes--this trait is more helpful in their youth, as they are not agile. Their skin is a unique, dense material which hardens further throughout their lives; the large spikes and bumps across their bodies form as a result of aging.\n\nIt\'s been said Forest Keepers exhibit a curious behavior similar to that of a human child the age of 5 or 6. They will eat anything they find fascinating. Forest Keepers don\'t actually need to put anything into their mouths, and it\'s theorized their main source of energy is a process similar to photosynthesis. Still, this makes them relatively dangerous to observe. They can see across long distances, so staying low and making use of cover is a must. They cannot enter small spaces and are not generally destructive, so stay close to shelter or overhangs.
# ForestGiant = 森林守護者\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：50%\n\n學名：Satyrid-proceritas\n據信與 rapax-folium 有共同的祖先，這些巨獸被稱為森林守護者，因為它們經常棲息在這些生物群落中。它們的身體前後都有模仿眼睛的標記——這個特徵在它們年輕時更有幫助，因為它們並不靈活。它們的皮膚是一種獨特的密集材料，隨著年齡的增長而進一步硬化；身體上的大刺和凸起是隨著年齡增長而形成的。\n\n據說森林守護者展現出類似於 5 或 6 歲人類孩童的好奇行為。它們會吃掉任何它們覺得有趣的東西。森林守護者實際上不需要將任何東西放入嘴中，據推測它們的主要能量來源是類似於光合作用的過程。儘管如此，這使得它們觀察起來相對危險。它們能夠在遠距離看見，因此保持低姿態並利用掩護是必須的。它們不能進入狹小的空間，通常不具破壞性，所以應靠近遮蔽處或懸崖邊。

# Default value: EARTH LEVIATHAN\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 2% cause they can\'t hide from the ship cmaeras!!\n\nScientific name: Hemibdella-gigantis\nThe reverently named Earth Leviathan, of the family Piscicolidae, is one of the largest invertibrates found around the Thistle Nebula. None have been captured, so not much is known of their biology. \n\nThey seem to behave as predators. It\'s speculated they can burrow as far as 40 meters underground, judging by the incredible excavations they can leave behind. They can detect even the slightest vibrations, and for this reason it\'s not recommended to stay still if they are nearby; that is a myth. Instead, if you hear them burrowing, retrace your steps.
# EarthLeviathan = 大地利維坦\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：2%，因為它們無法躲避船上的攝影機！！\n\n學名：Hemibdella-gigantis\n被尊敬地命名為大地利維坦，屬於 Piscicolidae 家族，是在薊星雲周圍發現的最大的無脊椎動物之一。由於沒有被捕獲過，因此對它們的生物學知之甚少。\n\n它們似乎表現為掠食者。根據它們留下的驚人挖掘痕跡來看，推測它們可以挖掘至地下 40 米深。它們甚至能察覺到最微小的震動，因此當它們在附近時，建議不要靜止不動；這是一個迷思。相反，如果你聽到它們在挖掘，應該回頭走。

# Default value: COIL-HEADS\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 80%\n\nScientific name: Vir colligerus\nVir colligerus, or colloquially named Coil-heads, have not been studied extensively due to their extreme unpredictability and dangerous properties. They have been known to combust into flames when being dissected or even deactivated, and they carry dangerously high levels of radioactive particles. Due to this and other reasons, it has been highly speculated they were created as biological weapons of war, although this has not been proven.\n\nCoil-heads\' visual appearance is that of a bloody mannequin with its head connected by a spring. Their defining behavioral characteristic is to stop when being looked at. However, this does not appear to be a hard-and-fast rule. When they encounter a loud or bright light they sometimes appear to enter a long reset mode. \nJust stare at htem or use a stun grenade! - Sigurd\n\n

# Default value: Spore lizard\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: i ,dont know probably 5% i just hate this pudgy legged little sh it\n\nScientific name: Lacerta-glomerorum\nColloquially named puffers or spore lizards, Lacerta-glomerorum (of the family Alligatoridae) is one of the largest and heaviest reptiles. Despite their large mouths, they are herbivores and do not have a strong bite. The bulbs on their tails are believed to secrete a chemical which attracts and accelerates the growth of the fungus species Lycoperdon perlatum, which it can then shake to release spores as a defense mechanism--an unique example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.\n\nSpore lizards have a very timid temperment, tending to avoid all confrontation if possible. If their attempts at threat display are not effective, they may attempt to attack, so it\'s not recommended to corner or chase one. There are historical records that spore lizards were at least partially domesticated hundreds of years ago, however this effort was set aside by an initiative to harvest their tails for their medicinal properties.
# Puffer = 孢子蜥蜴\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：我不知道，大概 5% 吧，我就是討厭這種短腿胖乎乎的小東西\n\n學名：Lacerta-glomerorum\n俗稱氣囊蜥或孢子蜥蜴，Lacerta-glomerorum（鱷科家族）是最大和最重的爬行動物之一。儘管它們有大嘴巴，但它們是草食性的，咬合力不強。據信它們尾巴上的球莖能分泌一種化學物質，吸引並加速真菌類 Lycoperdon perlatum 的生長，然後它們可以搖動以釋放孢子作為防禦機制——這是一個互利共生關係的獨特例子。\n\n孢子蜥蜴性情非常膽小，盡可能避免所有對抗。如果它們的威脅展示不起作用，它們可能會試圖攻擊，所以不建議將它們逼入角落或追逐。有歷史記錄顯示，數百年前孢子蜥蜴至少部分被馴化，但這項努力被擱置，因為有一項倡議要收集它們的尾巴以用於其藥用特性。

# Default value: Bunker spiders\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 20%\n\nScientific name: Mutinum-ficedula\nBunker spiders, of the genus Theraphosa, are the largest arachnid found in the Thistle Nebula and the second largest ever discovered. It\'s believed they evolved to prey on large mammals over the course of a measly several hundred years after the Boat made its trip around the Thistle Nebula. (Refer to: Speculation on Increased Speciation Around the Fading Nebulae)\n\nBunker spiders produce silk and lay it around their chosen nesting area, then wait for it to be tripped on. They can be seen waiting on walls, often over doorways where prey could enter unaware. If you find a bunker spider \'unprepared\' it may freeze as a defensive reaction. In this case they are best left alone. If a bunker spider reacts aggressively, it is best not to fight with ordinary tools. They use their webs to make up for their rather slow movement, so take note of your surroundings. Their webs can be broken easily with any blunt tool.\n\nBunker spiders can pose a great danger to humans and urban explorers especially, without a great benefit to their ecosystems. A resulting kill-on-sight order has been informally agreed upon between many states home to the Bunker spider, and it is currently approved by the ITDA as of 10/6/2497.
# BunkerSpider = 碉堡蜘蛛\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：20%\n\n學名：Mutinum-ficedula\n碉堡蜘蛛，屬於 Theraphosa 屬，是在薊星雲中發現的最大的蛛形動物，也是迄今為止發現的第二大蛛形動物。據信，在「小船」繞行薊星雲數百年後，它們進化成了以大型哺乳動物為獵物。（參見：關於逐漸消逝的星雲周圍物種增多的推測）\n\n碉堡蜘蛛會製造絲線，在它們選擇的築巢區域周圍鋪設，然後等待被觸發。它們常可在牆上看到，經常出現在門道上方，獵物可能在不知情的情況下進入。如果你發現一隻「毫無準備」的碉堡蜘蛛，它可能會作為防禦反應而凍僵。在這種情況下，最好不要去打擾它們。如果碉堡蜘蛛表現出攻擊性，最好不要用普通工具與之對抗。它們利用蜘蛛網來彌補它們相對緩慢的移動速度，所以要注意你的周圍環境。它們的網可以用任何鈍器輕易地打破。\n\n碉堡蜘蛛對人類和城市探險者尤其構成巨大威脅，而對生態系統並無太大益處。許多有碉堡蜘蛛出沒的州之間非正式地達成了即見即殺的協議，目前已於2497年10月6日獲得國際貿易發展協會（ITDA）的批准。

# Default value: Manticoils\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Quadrupes-manta\nMantacoils are a passerine bird of the family corvidae. Their bodies are quite large compared to their early descendants, and their wingspan ranges from 55 to 64 inches. Their most defining characteristic is their set of four wings. Their back wings are mostly used to stabilize when at low speed, while their front two wings create the majority of lift. Their round bodies are a striking yellow but with black outlines or stripes along their primary (rear) feathers.\n\nManticoils mostly feed on small insects but can also feed on small rodents. They are highly intelligent and social. They pose little threat and have a generally passive temperament towards humans, although they are capable of transmitting Rabies, Rubenchloria, and Pitt Virus.\n\n
# Manticoil = 四翼鳥\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：0%\n\n學名：Quadrupes-manta\n四翼鳥是鴉科的一種雀形目鳥類。它們的體型相比早期的祖先來說相當大，翅膀展開範圍在 55 至 64 英寸之間。它們最明顯的特徵是擁有四片翅膀。它們的後翅主要用於低速時的穩定，而前兩翅則產生大部分的升力。它們圓滾滾的身體呈醒目的黃色，但主要（後部）羽毛上有黑色輪廓或條紋。\n\n四翼鳥主要以小昆蟲為食，但也會捕食小型齧齒動物。它們非常聰明且社會性強。它們對人類構成的威脅很小，通常性情溫和，儘管它們有傳播狂犬病、Rubenchloria 和 Pitt 病毒的能力。\n\n

# Default value: Circuit Bees\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Crabro-coruscus\nThe circuit bee, also known as red bee, is a eusocial flying insect of the genus Apis, a descendent of the honey bee. Their appearance is quite recognizable from their hairy, red bodies and two sets of wings. Like their ancestors, they are well-known for their intelligent social BEEhavior, large colony size, building wax nests which they use to store honey, and their important role in pollination. Unlike the honey bee, which often chose high places such as trees to construct its hive, red bees create their hives on the ground.\n\nRed bees are highly defensive. They will leave the nest to attack any creature that comes within several meters, leaving BEEhind only the queen and drone bees. This bold BEEhavior is enabled by their most defining aBEElity, which is their electrostatic charge. Red bees produce friction with the air. They also produce friction by rubbing their two pairs of wings against each other and by rubbing against one another while in the hive. What allows them to create such a surplus of electric field compared to the honey bee is still under research, as they generate a stronger electric field when panicked or angered. This ability is especially useful for them around water.\n\n\n\nIt\'s BEEst to keep your distance. If a red bee hive is stolen, red bee swarms will enter an onslaught in which they attack any living creature. This destructive BEEhavior will last until they have located the hive or completely exhausted themselves, which can take hours to days. They have BEEn known to leave BEEhind fields of bodies of small rodents, insects and even some larger mammals, and in rare cases they can start fires. Their strong BEEnefits and drawbacks to their ecosystems are highly debated. BEEbated !! - the indomitable Sigurd

Date is August 27, 1968. \r\nwe make sure someone always has a shovel for bashing anything that moves, and we always put someone on \"camera duty\" so they can open these big security doors with letters and numbers. ask Desmond the wizard how that works, I think he just types in the code thats on the door\r. Thats it\n\r\nwe sold some goods to the company today at 70% value. i got m y nerves chilled listening to the fuckng PYSCHOTIC soundfs behind the counter. No one else gave any. ?? \r\nCant ignore that! my flashlight didn\'t even go back there, the beam just went dark.\n\n
# LogFile3Keyword = 過去幾天我們已經進入了“工作狀態”。這是Rich一直在說的，他聞起來像一罐腐爛的鮪魚罐頭。這是我經歷過的最糟糕的夏令營。日期是1968年8月27日。\r\n我們確保總有人拿著鏟子，隨時準備砸擊任何動的東西，我們總是讓某人負責“攝影機值勤”，這樣他們就可以打開那些帶有字母和數字的大型安全門。問問Desmond這位技術高手這是怎麼運作的，我想他只是輸入門上的代碼。\r那就是全部了。\n\r\n今天我們以70%的價值把一些貨物賣給了公司。聽著櫃檯後面那些該死的精神病般的聲音，我的神經都冷了下來。沒有其他人有任何反應。??\r\n不能忽視這一點！我的手電筒甚至沒有照到那裡，光束就變暗了。\n\n

Im just sitting. cant sleep on these tiny beds for ants\n\n\nIve been thinking a lot. i think this job is shady. If youre reading this you probbably got here the same as me. the pay is good, the contract only lasts a season. they ran you through their \"assessmennt exam\" on the phone with a weird voice. you signed the contract on the shuttle with the rest of your crew. But the whole time you didnt talk to anyone. The shuttle was autopiloted, I think the voice on the phone was fake.  I;ve had the wrost dreams, I think   I just want to go back home. but im not gonna crawl home, crying and scratching on dad\'s front door. thats not his son. thats not Sigurd!\n\n
# LogFile4Keyword = 日期是1968年8月31日。我又得擔任攝影機值勤，反正我討厭在這個月球上行走。哈哈，開玩笑的，它剛剛開始下雨了！！！我只是坐著。在這些給螞蟻的小床上根本睡不著。\n\n\n我一直在思考很多事情。我覺得這份工作有問題。如果你在讀這個，你可能和我一樣來到這裡。薪水不錯，合約只持續一個季節。他們透過電話用一種奇怪的聲音對你進行了“評估考試”。你和其他船員一起在太空梭上簽了合約。但是整個過程中你沒有和任何人講話。太空梭是自動駕駛的，我認為電話上的聲音是假的。我做了最糟糕的夢，我想我只是想回家。但我不會爬回家，在爸爸的前門哭泣和刮搔。那不是他的兒子。那不是Sigurd！\n\n

The rate was 120% which Desmond says is rare and he didnt want to miss it, hes been watching it like the stupid stocks. \n\nit still sucks here, Rich still smells like a piece of hsit .i can barely sleep. i heard the wrorst sound behind the wall of the company building, it sounded like crying red faces all churned up and swept away by concrete, like the pestle and bowl my mom crushes up her seeds and spices in. i still hear it. Its a nightmare. no one else heard it. they dont know what to do. Jess thinks i;m \"home sick,\" no im sick of this cheap suit\r\ndate: Septermber 4, 1968\n\n

I wanted to find Rich even if he was dead, but they are cowards! their faces are blank like idiots, theres nothing moving in their stupid skulls, all they wanted to do is leave. they were going to leave me too. we all hated Rich but we didnt want this. this isnt worth it, its just not worth it. we got a pair of scissors, a box full of stamps and a bundle of cords to sell for nothing. its not wort h it, what does the company even want it for?\n\n\nthe date we last saw Rich is September 7, 1968\n\n

# Default value: date: September 13, 1968\n\nfor some reason i was the one who had to call the company number to report the acciddent. they were too scared to do it. It was the same fake voice i remember from the interview on the phone at home and the stupid training videos. but it heard what i said i think, cause it said they would contact the family and find a replacement and something e lse. It talked so fast.\n\n\nI learned you can hear the screams all the time in the walkie talkie when you;re  at the wall of the Company building. they didnt believe me, well now they do.

He said the planet was swallowed up by the \"beast\", and they were in its body being diggested. i asked what the beast is, and he said he didnt know!. he said it ate the planet and they forgot everything. \r\n\r\ni couldnt get him to stop talking. but i said he was on the other side of a big wall and i could get him out. i said he was inside the building. and thats when he started freaking out/. i couldn\'t make out a word, I think he said something about \"spitting out the rinds\" So i just turned it off. what a wack\n\r\nJess says the golden planet is just a story. I said  I KNOW, I\'m not an idiot. Well she said i should quit, and she quits if i do. so she s staying\n\n
# LogFile8Keyword = 我在對講機上跟一個聲音講話，那聲音像是尖叫聲的一部分。他告訴我金星其實是真實存在的，不是傳說。他還說金星不只是撞上了一顆流星。他說那顆星球被“野獸”吞噬了，而他們正處於它的體內被消化。我問那野獸是什麼，他說他不知道！他說它吞噬了那顆星球，然後他們就忘記了一切。\r\n\r\n我無法讓他停止說話。但我說他在一堵厚牆的另一邊，我可以把他救出來。我說他在大樓裡面。那時他開始瘋狂地叫喊。我聽不清楚他在說什麼，我想他說了些關於“吐出果皮”的事。所以我就關掉了對講機。真是奇怪。\n\r\nJess說金星只是個故事。我說我知道，我不是傻瓜。她說我應該辭職，如果我辭職，她也會。所以她留下了。\n\n

The new crew member is named Lucas and he is so confused and scared a ll the time, what a baby, at least he doesnt smell like a monster.\r its been so sunny even though its september, and these suits dont take it well\nok so desmond \"traced the call\" and found out theres a group of people somewhere else that pretends to call us from the company building. they are across the whole solar system !! why would they be so far away.\r\n\nDesmond says he doesnt know, but i think. What if there really is a big monster in the company building like the voice told me on the wlakie talkie? They trapped it, and we feed it to keep it tame. i just wanted a stupid job!!!!! \n\n

So, what if its nothing? \r\ni started wondering how i cant remember how we really got here, no I just remember little things like the shuttle flight to the building where we signed our contracts.

# Default value: SNARE FLEA\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 30%\n\nScientific name: Dolus-scolopendra. \nA very large arthropod of the class chilopoda.

The snare flea does not produce venom, nor does it have a strong bite. It makes up for this weakness with its ability to tighten itself around large prey to suffocate.\n\nThe snare flea thrives in dark, warm areas.

# Default value: Bracken -- AKA flower man!\n\nit was flower man, you can\'t say othrwise! i wanted to find his body .You were the cowards\n\nScientific name: Rapax-folium\nThere is debate on the genus to which the Bracken belongs. It is a bipedal vertebrate with skin the color and texture of a red beat. The name was coined for what appear to be leaves protruding from its upper spine. The purpose of these is believed to be for intimidation, however not much is known about the specifics of bracken behaviour due to its illusiveness and low population.\n\nWe know a little from accounts by wildlife experts who have encountered it. is a lone hunter with high intelligence. Its behavior can seem aloof; it exhibits high aggression even when unprovoked, yet it quickly backs off when confronted. However, brackens are known to up their hostility when cornered or simply watched for a long time. For this reason it\'s recommended to keep an eye on it but not to stare it down. No specimens have been collected dead or alive. It\'s theorized that upon death their bodies undergo a rapid decomposition process which is unique from other large animals.\n\n
# Bracken = 花人布拉肯 -- 它就是花人，別的說法都不成立！\n\n我想找到它的屍體。你們都是懦夫。\n\n學名：Rapax-folium\n布拉肯屬於哪個屬仍有爭議。它是一種雙足脊椎動物，皮膚呈現紅色甜菜的顏色和質地。這個名稱是因為看起來像葉子從其上脊椎突出。這些葉子被認為是用來威嚇的，然而由於其神秘性和稀少的族群，關於布拉肯行為的具體細節仍不為人所知。\n\n我們從野生動物專家的描述中了解到一些信息。它是一個孤獨的獵手，智力高。它的行為看起來有些疏離；即使未受挑釁，它也表現出高度的侵略性，但面對對抗時卻迅速退縮。然而，當布拉肯被逼入絕境或被長時間觀察時，它們會增加敵意。因此，建議留意它，但不要盯著它。未曾收集到任何活體或死亡標本。有理論推測，它們死亡後的身體會經歷一個與其他大型動物不同的快速分解過程。\n\n

# Default value: HOARDING BUG\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Linepithema-crassus\nHoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.\n\nHoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd
# Hoarding bug = 囤積蟲\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：0%\n\n學名：Linepithema-crassus\n囤積蟲（膜翅目）是大型的、具社會性的昆蟲。雖然經常獨自生活，但它們也與同種成員共享巢穴。它們平均身高約3英尺，體型膨脹。它們的體液和血液的稀薄，以及甲殼的材質使它們體重輕，能夠用膜質翅膀飛行。這也使得它們的身體有些透明。\n\n囤積蟲因其領土性質而得名。一旦它們選擇了一個地方作為巢穴，就會尋找任何可以找到的物體來裝飾它，並將這些物體作為巢穴的一部分進行保護。囤積蟲單獨時並不像在大型蜂巢中那麼危險。然而，如果被單獨留下，囤積蟲出人意料地中立，並不構成太大危險。我們愛這些愚蠢的擁抱蟲！！ - 這是不屈不撓的 Sigurd 的留言。

# Default value: HYGRODERE\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%, if you\'re faster than a snail!\n\nScientific name: Hygrodere \nA eukaryotic organism classified within the paraphyletic group Prostita. With the incredible speed of reproduction, these small organisms can multiply to millions. Hygrodere rarely split apart, instead choosing to form large, viscous masses which can take up large amounts of space and become a danger to deal with, requiring large tools or lures to relocate.\n\nHygrodere are drawn to heat and oxygen and can detect it from seemingly anywhere. There\'s almost nothing organic they can\'t convert to their own body mass. Nothing has been found to poison them. Constantly replacing themselves, they can persist for hundreds of thousands of years. If you ever find yourself cornered, find a tall object to stand on top of; hygroderes have trouble climbing. they have great taste! cause I made a friend with one somehow,, and we think it was my music. \n
# Hygrodere = 史萊姆\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：0%，如果你比蝸牛快！\n\n學名：Hygrodere \n史萊姆是一種歸類於並系群 Prostita 的真核生物。這些小型生物具有驚人的繁殖速度，可以迅速繁殖至數百萬個體。水濕體很少分裂，而是選擇形成大型的黏稠體，這些黏稠體可以佔據大量空間，處理起來相當危險，需要大型工具或誘餌來重新定位。\n\n史萊姆被熱量和氧氣吸引，似乎可以從幾乎任何地方探測到這些元素。幾乎沒有什麼有機物質它們無法轉化為自己的體質。尚未發現任何對它們有毒的物質。它們不斷地自我更換，可以存活數十萬年。如果你發現自己被困住了，找一個高物體站在上面；水濕體不擅長攀爬。它們品味很好！因為我不知怎的與其中一個成了朋友，我們認為是我的音樂吸引了它。\n

# Default value: Thumpers\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Pistris-saevus\nHalves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.\n\nThey are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can\'t easily track prey.\n\nDue to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that thumpers are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.
# Thumper = 跳擊者\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：90%\n\n名：Pistris-saevus\n跳擊者，或稱為半身魚，是軟骨魚綱下一種極具攻擊性的肉食性物種。它們的骨骼是軟骨質的，賦予它們伸縮自如且類似橡膠的質地。它們的名稱來自於它們必須吃掉自己的下半部腿部才能逃脫孵化的蛋殼；它們的下半部腿部本來就幾乎無法正常功能。它們的前肢或前腿非常強壯，偶爾用來踏踏獵物。它們能夠在直線上達到極高的速度。\n\n它們是不知疲倦的獵手，通常位於食物鏈的頂端。它們的主要弱點是智力低下和完全缺乏聽力。如果你遇到跳擊者，生存的最佳方法是離開它的視線，因為它在轉彎時速度較慢，不容易追蹤獵物。\n\n由於這個物種快速且不穩定的進化，一些理論家認為跳擊者是在薊星雲周圍的行星上，突變數量增加導致更高物種分化水平的例子之一。

# Default value: EYELESS DOG\n\nScientific name: Leo caecus\nA large mammal of the class Saeptivus. They are social, hunting in very large packs. They have also been called \"breathing lions\" for their recognizable sound and large mouths. They are endurance hunters and attempt to make up for their lack of sight with their sense of hearing. It\'s a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs.\n\nTheir behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey\'s exact location which are often incorrect. 
# EyelessDog = 無眼犬\n\n學名：Leo caecus\n無眼犬是 Saeptivus 綱的一種大型哺乳動物。它們具有社會性，以非常大的群體進行狩獵。由於它們獨特的聲音和大嘴，它們也被稱為“呼吸的獅子”。它們是耐力型獵手，試圖以聽覺彌補視覺的缺失。流行的迷思是它們經常將自己同類的聲音誤認為獵物，導致在自己的群體內發生爭鬥。\n\n無眼犬的行為與其他群居動物不同，它們傾向於分散開來覆蓋更大的距離。當無眼犬發現獵物時，它會吼叫以警告附近的其他同類，這些同類也會發出警報，有時會導致一種連鎖反應。無眼犬在成群時可能非常危險。然而，它們在性格上笨拙，對獵物確切位置的猜測往往不準確。

# Default value: FOREST KEEPER\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 50%\n\nScientific name: Satyrid-proceritas\nBelieved to share a common ancestor with rapax-folium, these behemoths are called Forest Keepers for the biomes they often inhabit. Their bodies bare markings on their front and back which mimic eyes--this trait is more helpful in their youth, as they are not agile. Their skin is a unique, dense material which hardens further throughout their lives; the large spikes and bumps across their bodies form as a result of aging.\n\nIt\'s been said Forest Keepers exhibit a curious behavior similar to that of a human child the age of 5 or 6. They will eat anything they find fascinating. Forest Keepers don\'t actually need to put anything into their mouths, and it\'s theorized their main source of energy is a process similar to photosynthesis. Still, this makes them relatively dangerous to observe. They can see across long distances, so staying low and making use of cover is a must. They cannot enter small spaces and are not generally destructive, so stay close to shelter or overhangs.
# ForestGiant = 森林守護者\n\nSigurd 的危險等級：50%\n\n學名：Satyrid-proceritas\n據信與 rapax-folium 有共同的祖先，這些巨獸被稱為森林守護者，因為它們經常棲息在這些生物群落中。它們的身體前後都有模仿眼睛的標記——這個特徵在它們年輕時更有幫助，因為它們並不靈活。它們的皮膚是一種獨特的密集材料，隨著年齡的增長而進一步硬化；身體上的大刺和凸起是隨著年齡增長而形成的。\n\n據說森林守護者展現出類似於 5 或 6 歲人類孩童的好奇行為。它們會吃掉任何它們覺得有趣的東西。森林守護者實際上不需要將任何東西放入嘴中，據推測它們的主要能量來源是類似於光合作用的過程。儘管如此，這使得它們觀察起來相對危險。它們能夠在遠距離看見，因此保持低姿態並利用掩護是必須的。它們不能進入狹小的空間，通常不具破壞性，所以應靠近遮蔽處或懸崖邊。

None have been captured, so not much is known of their biology. \n\nThey seem to behave as predators. It\'s speculated they can burrow as far as 40 meters underground, judging by the incredible excavations they can leave behind.

Despite their large mouths, they are herbivores and do not have a strong bite. The bulbs on their tails are believed to secrete a chemical which attracts and accelerates the growth of the fungus species Lycoperdon perlatum, which it can then shake to release spores as a defense mechanism--an unique example of a mutualistic symbiotic relationship.\n\nSpore lizards have a very timid temperment, tending to avoid all confrontation if possible. If their attempts at threat display are not effective, they may attempt to attack, so it\'s not recommended to corner or chase one. There are historical records that spore lizards were at least partially domesticated hundreds of years ago, however this effort was set aside by an initiative to harvest their tails for their medicinal properties.

# Default value: Bunker spiders\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 20%\n\nScientific name: Mutinum-ficedula\nBunker spiders, of the genus Theraphosa, are the largest arachnid found in the Thistle Nebula and the second largest ever discovered. It\'s believed they evolved to prey on large mammals over the course of a measly several hundred years after the Boat made its trip around the Thistle Nebula. (Refer to: Speculation on Increased Speciation Around the Fading Nebulae)\n\nBunker spiders produce silk and lay it around their chosen nesting area, then wait for it to be tripped on. They can be seen waiting on walls, often over doorways where prey could enter unaware. If you find a bunker spider \'unprepared\' it may freeze as a defensive reaction. In this case they are best left alone. If a bunker spider reacts aggressively, it is best not to fight with ordinary tools. They use their webs to make up for their rather slow movement, so take note of your surroundings. Their webs can be broken easily with any blunt tool.\n\nBunker spiders can pose a great danger to humans and urban explorers especially, without a great benefit to their ecosystems. A resulting kill-on-sight order has been informally agreed upon between many states home to the Bunker spider, and it is currently approved by the ITDA as of 10/6/2497.

Their appearance is quite recognizable from their hairy, red bodies and two sets of wings. Like their ancestors, they are well-known for their intelligent social BEEhavior, large colony size, building wax nests which they use to store honey, and their important role in pollination. Unlike the honey bee, which often chose high places such as trees to construct its hive, red bees create their hives on the ground.\n\nRed bees are highly defensive. They will leave the nest to attack any creature that comes within several meters, leaving BEEhind only the queen and drone bees. This bold BEEhavior is enabled by their most defining aBEElity, which is their electrostatic charge. Red bees produce friction with the air. They also produce friction by rubbing their two pairs of wings against each other and by rubbing against one another while in the hive. What allows them to create such a surplus of electric field compared to the honey bee is still under research, as they generate a stronger electric field when panicked or angered. This ability is especially useful for them around water.\n\n\n\nIt\'s BEEst to keep your distance. If a red bee hive is stolen, red bee swarms will enter an onslaught in which they attack any living creature. This destructive BEEhavior will last until they have located the hive or completely exhausted themselves, which can take hours to days. They have BEEn known to leave BEEhind fields of bodies of small rodents, insects and even some larger mammals, and in rare cases they can start fires. Their strong BEEnefits and drawbacks to their ecosystems are highly debated. BEEbated !! - the indomitable Sigurd

My brother said i should keep a journal so im doing what i can! I am writing in a proffessional manner, as these logs could become a historical record, as they will projbably be here for years, just as long as there isnt a clean wipe. that is what desmond saidfd\n\n\nIf you are reading it in the future, you are probably from a nother crew.
