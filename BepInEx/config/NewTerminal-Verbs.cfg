# Default value: HOARDING BUG\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 0%\n\nScientific name: Linepithema-crassus\nHoarding bugs (of the order Hymenoptera) are large, social insects. While often found living alone, they have been found to share their nests with members of their own species. They measure a height of 3 feet on average, with bulbous bodies. The thinness of their fluid and blood and the material of their carapaces contributes to their low weight, making them capable of flight with their membranous wings. It also makes their bodies somewhat transparent.\n\nHoarding bugs were given their name due to their territorial nature. Once they have chosen a place as their nest, they will seek to adorn it with any object they can find and will protect these objects as a part of the nest. Hoarding bugs are not so dangerous alone as they are in large hives. However, if left alone, hoarding bugs are surprisingly neutral and pose little danger. wWe love the stupid cuddle bugs.!! - tjhis has been a note from the indomitable Sigurd

# Default value: Thumpers\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 90%\n\nScientific name: Pistris-saevus\nHalves, or Thumpers, are a highly aggressive, carnivorous species of the order Chondrichthyes. Their skeletons are cartilaginous, giving their bodies a stretchy and rubbery quality. Their name comes from the fact they must eat their bottom legs in order to escape the shell of their hatched egg; their bottom legs are hardly functional to begin with. Their arms, or front legs, are very strong, and they occasionally use them to stomp prey. They can reach great speeds in a straight line.\n\nThey are relentless hunters, typically at the top of their food chain. Their main weaknesses are their intelligence and complete lack of hearing. If you come across a thumper, your best means of survival are leaving its line of sight, as it is slower around corners and can\'t easily track prey.\n\nDue to the fast and volatile evolution of this species, some theorize that thumpers are one of the examples of an increased number of mutations causing higher levels of speciation in planets around the Thistle Nebula.

# Default value: EYELESS DOG\n\nScientific name: Leo caecus\nA large mammal of the class Saeptivus. They are social, hunting in very large packs. They have also been called \"breathing lions\" for their recognizable sound and large mouths. They are endurance hunters and attempt to make up for their lack of sight with their sense of hearing. It\'s a popular myth that they often mistake the sounds of their own kind for prey, entering fights within their own packs.\n\nTheir behaviour is unique from other pack animals in their tendency to spread out far to cover distance. When an eyeless dog has found prey, it roars to alert others in the near vicinity, who will also sound the alarm, sometimes resulting in a kind of chain reaction. Eyeless dogs can be dangerous in swarms. However, they are characteristically clumsy, taking guesses at their prey\'s exact location which are often incorrect.

# Default value: FOREST KEEPER\n\nSigurd\'s danger level: 50%\n\nScientific name: Satyrid-proceritas\nBelieved to share a common ancestor with rapax-folium, these behemoths are called Forest Keepers for the biomes they often inhabit. Their bodies bare markings on their front and back which mimic eyes--this trait is more helpful in their youth, as they are not agile. Their skin is a unique, dense material which hardens further throughout their lives; the large spikes and bumps across their bodies form as a result of aging.\n\nIt\'s been said Forest Keepers exhibit a curious behavior similar to that of a human child the age of 5 or 6. They will eat anything they find fascinating. Forest Keepers don\'t actually need to put anything into their mouths, and it\'s theorized their main source of energy is a process similar to photosynthesis. Still, this makes them relatively dangerous to observe. They can see across long distances, so staying low and making use of cover is a must. They cannot enter small spaces and are not generally destructive, so stay close to shelter or overhangs.
