# Lethal Company Latin Translation

Below is a breakdown of the files in this latin language mod

## Top Level Files (Required for mod)
1. CHANGELOG.md - the changes to your mod over time
2. README.md - a description of your mod
3. icon.png - a 256x256 image for your mod
4. manifest.json - metadata about the mod

## The config folder

The config folder contains the translations:

1. NewTerminal-Other, Special, & Verbs are the phrases that can show up in the terminal itself
2. la-VA - Contains all of the other translations in latin (I chose la-VA for the vatican, but you can use the language code for your language)

The other important file is `AutoTranslatorConfig.ini` which is where you set the language code like `la-VA` or whatever you chose. (Ex. Language=la-VA)
