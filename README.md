#### Boombox Controller & LuckReservedBoombox

I enjoy playing with [a reserved boombox](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Luck/LuckReservedBoombox/) on me at all times, [that plays latin playlists from youtube](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/KoderTeh/Boombox_Controller/).

#### Television Controller

You can also upload youtube videos to the tv, using [the Television Controller mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/KoderTeh/Television_Controller/)!
